<h5>A little explanation about the MakeMeow code</h5>

# <h3>main.js</h3>

- imports the Venom-Bot module, which is a library for easier usage of WhatsApp Web in bots.

```
const venom = require('venom-bot');
```
##

- imports the dotenv module, used for setting environment variables from the <code>.env</code> file.

```
require('dotenv').config();
```
##

- imports the fs (file system) module, used for reading directories and files.

```
const fs = require('fs');
```
##

- imports the path module, used for constructing file paths.

```
const path = require('path');
```
##

- creates a WhatsApp session using Venom-Bot with the session name 'sessionName'. You can replace 'sessionName' with your desired session name.

```
venom.create('sessionName')
```

##

- is the function executed after the WhatsApp session is successfully created.
- Console.log statements display information about the bot, such as the developer, version, and contact details.

```
start(client)
```
##

-  function is used to import the available plugins from the 'plugins' directory.
-  The plugins are dynamically loaded using <code>require(pluginPath)(client)</code>, where <code>pluginPath</code> is the full path to the plugin and <code>client</code> is the WhatsApp client object provided by Venom-Bot.

```
importPlugins()
```
##

- exports the WhatsApp client object, allowing other parts of the code to access and use it.

```
module.exports.client = venom.client;
```

# <h3>index.js</h3>

```
const { client } = require('./main');
const path = require('path');

client.onMessage((message) => {
  console.log('Received message:', message.body);
});

const runtimePlugin = require('./plugins/runtime');

runtimePlugin(client);
```
##

- imports the <code>client</code> object from the 'main' module. It assumes that there is a file named 'main.js' or 'main.js' in the same directory as the current file.

```
const { client } = require('./main');
```
##

- ets up an event listener for incoming messages. When a new message is received, the callback function is executed, and the received message's body is logged to the console using <code>console.log()</code>.

```
client.onMessage((message) => { ... });
```
##

- imports the 'runtime' plugin from the 'plugins' directory, assuming that there is a file named 'runtime.js' or 'runtime.js' in that directory.

```
const runtimePlugin = require('./plugins/runtime');
```
##

-  invokes the 'runtimePlugin' function and passes the WhatsApp client object as an argument. This allows the plugin to interact with the client and perform its designated tasks

```
runtimePlugin(client);
```
